    "text": "After briefly skimming over the content of our future labs, I am already extremely excited for the semester to come! As someone who wants to specialize in, essentially, ECE (with a little side of mechanical engineering to boot!), this is the perfect course for me; it seems to cover a good amount of the overlap between programming and actual hardware development, which I have always wanted to dive more into. Because I did rather poorly on the exams in E85, I am admittedly also a little nervous for this course’s rigor. However, seeing as E155’s learning is not test-based in the slightest, I do not feel as stressed out about my performance as I could be.\nAt the moment, I do not have any particular ideas in mind for the final project. If possible, I would like to do something that involves working with LEDs (or other lights), for I find such projects satisfyingly aesthetic and fun, but I am not too picky on the content beyond that. I have faith that no matter what, it will be a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience for me.\nMy goals for this semester comprise the following: stay on top of my work, make the most of the resources available to me (including grutors and professors), create a final project that I can be proud of, and maintain an open and positive mindset, even when times get hard. While I would naturally like to succeed academically in this class, I believe that these more soft skill-oriented objectives are just as - if not more - important than attaining good grades. Overall, I hope to come out of this course as both a better engineer and person."
