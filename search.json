    "text": "After briefly skimming over the content of our future labs, I am already extremely excited for the semester to come! As someone who wants to specialize in, essentially, ECE (with a little side of mechanical engineering to boot!), this is the perfect course for me; it seems to cover a good amount of the overlap between programming and actual hardware development, which I have always wanted to dive more into. Because I did rather poorly on the exams in E85, I am admittedly also a little nervous for this course’s rigor. However, seeing as E155’s learning is not test-based in the slightest, I do not feel as stressed out about my performance as I could be.\nAt the moment, I do not have any particular ideas in mind for the final project. If possible, I would like to do something that involves working with LEDs (or other lights), for I find such projects satisfyingly aesthetic and fun, but I am not too picky on the content beyond that. I have faith that no matter what, it will be a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience for me.\nMy goals for this semester comprise the following: stay on top of my work, make the most of the resources available to me (including grutors and professors), create a final project that I can be proud of, and maintain an open and positive mindset, even when times get hard. While I would naturally like to succeed academically in this class, I believe that these more soft skill-oriented objectives are just as - if not more - important than attaining good grades. Overall, I hope to come out of this course as both a better engineer and person."

    "text": "In this lab, the development board that will be used for the rest of the course was fully assembled, and the MCU and FPGA were respectively tested to ensure proper functionality. The FPGA was then programmed with behavioral SystemVerilog code with the aim of blinking one on-board LED at a constant 2.4 Hz, using the internal high-frequency (48 MHz) oscillator, and two other on-board LEDs according to four slide-switch positions; more specifically, interpreting the expected relationship between the LEDs and switches (as outlined in the Lab 1 instructions) as a truth table dictated that one would act as the output of a XOR gate, whereas the second would act as the output of an AND gate. Additionally, a 7-segment display was interfaced with the those same four slide-switches, such that it was able to display hexadecimal digits 0x0 through 0xF."

How do you feel like the course is helping you to grow as a person? Reflect on the character traits you listed at the beginning of the course for ideas about specific areas of growth to reflect on. What did you think about a recent AI prototype? How did your use of AI shape your thinking about what role these tools might play in the future of digital hardware design?
