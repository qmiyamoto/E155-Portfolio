## Lab 1: [FPGA and MCU Setup and Testing](labs/lab1/lab1.qmd)
Assembled the development board for the course and verified the MCU and FPGA's respective functionalities.
Programmed the FPGA with behavioral Verilog to blink on-board LEDs according to slide-switch positions and interface a 7-segment display, such that it would display hexadecimal digits 0x0 through 0xF.

## Lab 2: [Multiplexed 7-Segment Display](labs/lab2/lab2.qmd)
Implemented a time-multiplexing scheme to switch between displaying hexadecimal digits 0x0 through 0xF on two separate 7-segment displays, at such a frequency that the switch would be imperceptible to the human eye.
Utilized transistors to drive large currents from the FPGA pins to the two 7-segment displays.
Interfaced the FPGA with five external LEDs, such that they would display the sum of the two hexadecimal digits at any given point in time.

## Lab 3: [Keypad Scanner](labs/lab3/lab3.qmd)
Designed and implemented a circuit to interface the FPGA with a 4x4 matrix keypad, such that it would accurately read the pressed buttons and subsequently output the two most recent digits on two 7-segment displays.
Effectively dealt with switch bouncing.
Ensured that any combination of asynchronous user inputs — including, but not limited to, pressing multiple buttons at once and holding buttons for extended periods of time — did not result in erratic, undesirable behavior.
