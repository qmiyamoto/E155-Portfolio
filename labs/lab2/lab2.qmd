The block diagram in [Figure 1](#fig-block-diagram) depicts the general architecture implied by the SystemVerilog code.

### Schematic

In order to attain current draw that fell within the recommended operating conditions of 5 - 20 mA, Ohm's Law was applied to ultimately determine that any resistors ranging from 20 Ω to 240 Ω were acceptable to use.
For the sake of equal brightness across all segments, seven 160 Ω-resistors were integrated into the [Figure 2](#fig-schematic) schematic.

## Results and Discussion {#sec-results-and-discussion}
