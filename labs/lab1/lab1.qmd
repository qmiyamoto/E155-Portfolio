title: "Lab 1: FPGA and MCU Setup and Testing"
---

## Introduction
In this lab, the development board that will be used for the rest of the course was fully assembled, and the MCU and FPGA were respectively tested to ensure proper functionality.
The FPGA was then programmed with behavioral SystemVerilog code with the aim of blinking one on-board LED at a constant 2.4 Hz, using the internal high-frequency (48 MHz) oscillator, and two other on-board LEDs according to four slide-switch positions; more specifically, interpreting the expected relationship between the LEDs and switches (as outlined in the [Lab 1 instructions](https://hmc-e155.github.io/lab/lab1/#fpga-design)) as a truth table dictated that one would act as the output of a XOR gate, whereas the second would act as the output of an AND gate.
Additionally, a 7-segment display was interfaced with the those same four slide-switches, such that it was able to display hexadecimal digits 0x0 through 0xF.

## Design and Testing Methodology
